         <p>
             From a recent Informative Speech assignment, I discussed the Internet of Things.<br>
             The Internet of Things is a fascinating topic because it has so much potential! We know,
             that as technology progresses the capacity for it to adapt to an ever-changing environment
             is what will make it practical.<br> --- The definition is simple, devices that exist in a network
             share their experiences with one another and unlitmately, the user. The internet is, in a very
             real way, connected to the physical world through various sensors. For more info check out this increidible video,

             <br> <br> What is most appealing to me is the amount of efficiency that can be achieved in this system. 
             When every device has the ability to communicate, there is no factor of human error. No switch is left on and nothing will conserve more energy than necessary. 
             This will influence our future for the better, I do feel that it must become more adaptable in peoples lives so it can be accepted.

             I have spent a large amount of time reading and watching videos about semiconductors and The Manufacturing Process of Integrated Circuit.
             With this, I read a very intersting book detailing the history of Fairchild Semiconductor called <i>Makers of The Microchip</i> which 
             provided me with information from a very personal level of how the company was established.

            <h1>2019 Christmas PCB Showcase</h1>
            <h6> <center> Because last year's Christmas PCB was well recieved
                decided to make it a tradition. With this page I will condense the process
                I went through to design the Christmas PCB of 2019 while
                sharing the improvements since last year. </center>
            </h6>
            <img src="./images/pcbChaser.png">
            
            <p> 
                   After contemplating other ideas, I settled with
                a <u>LED Chaser Ornament</u> whose frequency can be varied
                by a potentiometer.
                <br>
                The main reason I chose this is because I have recently been learning
                from books like <u><i>Feynman Lectures on Computation</i></u> and <u><i>TTL Cookbook</i></u>
                how transistors function on every level and how Integrated Circuits are made. I am fascinated
                by both of these topics and have decided to attain a greater uunderstanding by building and analyzing a 
                circuit using ICs as a Counter (cd4017 IC) and a VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator 555).
                    <br> ...more in-depth analysis later, this will not be added to the homepage until completion.
                <h6><ul> --- The software used in this project is KiCad and I have found that it is not my favorite,
                    compared to DipTrace which was used last year, KiCad felt vastly inferior.
                 </ul> </h6> 
                 
                <h6><ul> --- The solder mask is white with lead free pads because I admire<br>
                    the white-on-silver contrast. I have also added a hole at the top-middle of 
                    the board for convenient hanging. No image is included like last years but the 
                    text is clear to see against the background and is not under the mask like last year's.
