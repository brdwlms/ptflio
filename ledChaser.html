            <h1>2019 Christmas PCB Showcase</h1>
            <h6> Because last year's Christmas PCB was all the rave, I have <br> 
                 decided to start a tradition. From this page I will condense the process <br>
                 I went through to design the Christmas PCB of 2019 while<br>
                sharing the improvements since last year.
            </h6>
            <img src="./images/pcbChaser.png">
            
            <p> 
                   After contemplating other ideas, I settled with
                a <u>LED Chaser Ornament</u> whose frequency can be varied
                by a potentiometer.
                <br>
                The main reason I chose this is because I have recently been learning
                from books like <u><i>Feynman Lectures on Computation</i></u> and <u><i>TTL Cookbook</i></u>
                how transistors function on every level and how Integrated Circuits are made. I am fascinated
                by both of these topics and have decided to attain a greater uunderstanding by building and analyzing a 
                circuit using ICs as a Counter (cd4017 IC) and a VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator 555).
                    <br> ...more in-depth analysis later, this will not be added to the homepage until completion.
                <h6><ul> --- The software used in this project is KiCad and I have found that it is not my favorite,
                    compared to DipTrace which was used last year, KiCad felt vastly inferior.
                 </ul> </h6> 
                 
                <h6><ul> --- The solder mask is white with lead free pads because I admire<br>
                    the white-on-silver contrast. I have also added a hole at the top-middle of 
                    the board for convenient hanging. No image is included like last years but the 
                    text is clear to see against the background and is not under the mask like last year's. 
                 </ul> </h6>
