             The Internet of Things

         <p>
             From a recent Informative Speech assignment, I discussed the Internet of Things.<br>
             The Internet of Things is a fascinating topic because it has so much potential! We know,
             that as technology progresses the capacity for it to adapt to an ever-changing environment
             is what will make it practical.<br> --- The definition is simple, devices that exist in a network
             share their experiences with one another and unlitmately, the user. The internet is, in a very
             real way, connected to the physical world through various sensors. For more info check out this increidible video, 
             <br>
             <br> <a href = "https://youtu.be/_AlcRoqS65E" > What is the Internet of Things? And why should you care? | Benson Hougland | TEDxTemecula  (YouTube Link)</a> 

             <br> <br> What is most appealing to me is the amount of efficiency that can be achieved in this system. 
             When every device has the ability to communicate, there is no factor of human error. No switch is left on and nothing will conserve more energy than necessary. 
             This will influence our future for the better, I do feel that it must become more adaptable in peoples lives so it can be accepted.

             I have spent a large amount of time reading and watching videos about semiconductors and The Manufacturing Process of Integrated Circuit.
             With this, I read a very intersting book detailing the history of Fairchild Semiconductor called <i>Makers of The Microchip</i> which 
             provided me with information from a very personal level of how the company was established. Other books I have read to learn more about this 
             topic include the <i>TTL Cookbook</i> by Don Lancaster and <i> The Feynman Lectures on Computation </i> by Richard P. Feynamn (edited by Tony Hey and Robert Allen).

        I believe it is important to acknowledge what is beyond terrestrial life.
        <br>
        Another interest I sharing is Astronomy, I use an 8 inch in diameter <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian_telescope" >Dobsonian Telescope</a>
        equiped with a 3D Printed adapter so I can use a GoPro camera to take decent images. The above photo was taken on 1/4/20 during the Quarantids Meteor Shower.

    3D Printing with OctoPi

<p>
    I decided to automate my 3D Printer.
    <br>
    In mid 2019, I took responibility with a shop on Etsy selling 3D Printed sculptures. I ended up running
    my printer 24/7 while at school and felt on edge leaving it on with no one to monitor. I followed a YouTube 
    tutorial and set up OctoPi with plugins like OctoPrint Anywhere and The Spagetti Detective all controled by a Raspberry Pi ZeroW and my Wifi Network.
    With these plugins, I was able to view and control my printer from school, The Spagetti Detective would even use AI to monitor the print and 
    send me an email if it is starting to look like plastic spagetti. <br>

    SpaceX and Virgin Orbit Tour 2019

    Our engineering club was fortunate enough to arrange tours with two revolutionary companies, SpaceX and Virgin Orbit. 
    <br>
    <br>
   <a href="https://www.spacex.com/"> SpaceX </a> <br>
    This tour was absolutely incredible. We were blown inspired by the workflow and amount of technology present. Our group learned about the processes that go into developing and testing new
        systems as well as how these tests are monitored through the control room. Yet another great feature was seeing the autonomous Tesla Model S security cars and the table Elon Musk
       <i>sometimes</i> eats at. 
        <br>
        <br>
   <a href="https://virginorbit.com/"> Virgin Orbit </a> <br>
    As an up-and-coming small-satellite launching company, only a few years old, Virgin Orbit already has so much to offer in the industry and a great amount of potential in its future. 
    I was delighted to meet the president and CEO Dan Hart while touring. This experience was very valuble to everyone of us, I was pleased to show our engineering club how Virgin Orbit develops
    their own rocket thruster cones in-house using a Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D Printer. I have been keeping up with their news and am looking forward to attending their first tests!

            <h1>2019 Christmas PCB Showcase</h1>
            <h6> <center> Because last year's Christmas PCB was well recieved
                decided to make it a tradition. With this page I will condense the process
                I went through to design the Christmas PCB of 2019 while
                sharing the improvements since last year. </center>

            <p> 
                   After contemplating other ideas, I settled with
                a <u>LED Chaser Ornament</u> whose frequency can be varied
                by a potentiometer.
                <br>
                The main reason I chose this is because I have recently been learning
                from books like <u><i>Feynman Lectures on Computation</i></u> and <u><i>TTL Cookbook</i></u>
                how transistors function on every level and how Integrated Circuits are made. I am fascinated
                by both of these topics and have decided to attain a greater uunderstanding by building and analyzing a 
                circuit using ICs as a Counter (cd4017 IC) and a VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator 555).
                    <br> ...more in-depth analysis later, this will not be added to the homepage until completion.
                <h6><ul> --- The software used in this project is KiCad and I have found that it is not my favorite,
                    compared to DipTrace which was used last year, KiCad felt vastly inferior.
